- You should be able to configure the keys that it will auto populate for each kind of resource
- The tool should automatically detect the kind of resoruce if it can and if not default to something
  - Users can specify the kind of resource if they want to force a type
- There should be some generic optinos like `consumed date` for which the config would look like `consumed: $date`
- I think we should think of it as templateing but with variables passed in by a go program
